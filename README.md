# PyBer_Analysis
**

Overview**
The purpose of this assignment was to utilize our understanding of Pandas data frames and use Matplotlib library to create graphs based on that data. We were able to use our knowledge to show the three types of cities (rural, urban, suburban) and see the differences between fares in terms of drivers vs. riders within the cities. 

**Results**

Within urban areas, it has the highest total ride count. This can be attributed to the density of the population, which can lead to people not owning cars because of the lack of space. Rural areas are shown to have the lowest total ride count. This would be for the exact opposite reason of the urban population, as there would be less people within the area, therefore more of a reason for people to own their own cars. Furthermore, the price of rural areas is increased since there is a smaller customer base while the fare is better in both suburban and urban areas since they have larger populations. Suburban areas seem to hold the middle ground between urban and rural areas, as their population is not as low as rural areas, yet not as high and dense in comparison to urban. Furthermore, because rural areas are more spread out, drivers must cover more distance, and this may be another contributing factor for as to why it has the highest average fare per ride. It can also be seen that March appears to have the lower fare prices overall for all three city types. Towards the middle of the year, the information begins to spike up and down generally for the three cities as well. 


**Summary**
Recommendations:
1.	Among the city types, despite the rural population having the highest fare amount, it has the lowest total fare. More drivers could be allocated to rural locations through incentives such as job benefits in order to lower the overall cost of the fare and increasing the total fare.
2.	Towards the middle of the year, it can be seen that overall, the data begins to spike up and down. Displaying things such as advertisements may allow for a steadier source of income as it would consistently bring in more customers.
3.	The average fare per driver is a lot lower than the average fare per ride, only in the Urban cities. Perhaps experimenting with the number of drivers within the urban areas would also be beneficial, seeing whether or not having more drivers would lead to an increase/decrease in overall profits.
